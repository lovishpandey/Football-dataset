# Football-dataset

The aim is to predict the overall rating of soccer player based on their attributes such as 'crossing', 'finishing etc. 

I have done some preprocessing of the data , then proceeded with application of linear regression on the final preprocessed dataset 

I have also used Regularisation approaches to check whether if the accuracy can be improved or not .

This database consists of several tables out of which we have used "Player_Attributes" table for the Linear regresssion algorithm .
